# OpenBoards

OpenBoards is a web application that allows users to create and join board game sessions. Users can specify the game they want to play, upload a cover image, provide details such as number of open spots, a brief description of the players, and the date and time of the session.

The application also features a detail page, a button for users to delete their own created sessions, a button for users to create new sessions, and a button for users to join existing sessions.

The technology stack used in OpenBoards includes React, Redux Toolkit, styled-components, and Jest for testing. The application has been deployed on a hosting service of choice, such as Netlify.

In the future, the application could be expanded to include additional features such as a chat feature for users to communicate and coordinate before and during game sessions, or a feature for users to rate and review game sessions they have participated in.

To use OpenBoards, users will need to have the following tools installed:

- Node.js
- React
- Redux Toolkit

To run the test suite, use the npm test command. To deploy OpenBoards to a production environment, use the npm run build command to build a production-ready version of the app, and then serve it using a static file server or hosting service.

## Features

Users can create a new game session, specifying the board game, the number of available spots, a brief description of the session and its specifications, and the date and time of the session.
Users can view the list of game sessions created by all users, and filter the list by board game or date.
Users can view the details of a specific game session, including the session creator's information and the number of available spots.
Users can delete their own game sessions.
Users can create an account and log in to access additional features, such as creating and deleting their own game sessions.

## Tech stack

- React: frontend library for building web applications
- Redux Toolkit: a library that provides a simple and efficient way to manage application state
- Jest: a popular JavaScript testing framework
- React testing library: popular JavaScript library used for testing React applications.

## Future implementations

Allow users to modify their own game sessions
Allow users to join other users' game sessions

## Getting Started

To get started using OpenBoards, you'll need to have the following tools installed:

- Node.js
- React
- Redux Toolkit

## Running Tests

OpenBoards uses Jest for unit and integration tests. To run the test suite, use the npm test command.

## Deployment

To deploy OpenBoards to a production environment, you can use a hosting service such as Netlify. You'll need to run the npm run build command to build a production-ready version of the app. This will generate a build directory containing the compiled code, which you can then deploy to your hosting service.
